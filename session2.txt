Key Points: Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

Definition: SDLC outlines the stages of software development from concept to delivery, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and user satisfaction.


Phases:
1) Planning: Define goals, objectives, and user requirements; create a project plan.
2) Analysis: Analyze user requirements, check feasibility, and determine resources.
3) Design: Create detailed plans for UI, architecture, and components.
4) Implementation: Write, test, and debug code to develop software.
5) Testing: Conduct various tests (unit, integration, user acceptance) to ensure quality.
6) Deployment: Deliver software to users; ensure smooth installation or setup.
7) Maintenance: Fix bugs, update features, and ensure software longevity.


Roles in Software Development:

1) Software Developer/Engineer: Codes, tests, and maintains software.
2) Front-End Developer: Focuses on user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).
3) Back-End Developer: Manages server-side logic, databases, and APIs.
4) Full-Stack Developer: Handles both front-end and back-end development.
5) DevOps Engineer: Automates deployment, optimizes CI/CD pipelines.
6) QA Engineer: Ensures software quality via manual and automated testing.
7) Software Architect: Designs high-level architecture and system frameworks.
8) Project Manager: Oversees timelines, budgets, and team coordination.
9) UX/UI Designer: Creates user-friendly and visually appealing designs.
10) Business Analyst: Bridges stakeholder requirements with technical teams.
11) Security Engineer: Secures software against vulnerabilities.


Frontend vs. Backend Development


Frontend (Client-Side):
Focus: Visuals and user interactions.
Tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks like React and Angular.
Tasks: UI design, responsive layouts, performance optimization.


Backend (Server-Side):
Focus: Data processing and application logic.
Tools: Python, Java, Node.js, databases (SQL/NoSQL), and APIs.
Tasks: Authentication, database management, and server functionality.


Full-Stack Development
Definition: Combines front-end and back-end development.
Scope:
Front-End: UI design, responsiveness, and interactivity.
Back-End: Server logic, database management, and API integration.
Tools: Git, cloud platforms, Docker, Kubernetes.


Conclusion
Frontend focuses on user experience and design; backend handles data and server logic.
SDLC ensures structured development, while collaboration between roles ensures project success.
